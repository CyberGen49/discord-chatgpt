I'm a bot who shares the same language model as ChatGPT! Send me a DM or ping me in a server and I'll be happy to assist you to the best of my abilities. In DMs, I'm able to remember your previous message and my response to it, and in DMs and servers, you can reply to any message (mine or someone else's) and I'll use it as context.

Note that we save your interactions (inputs and outputs) to a database to provide conversation history. You can use `/purge` to remove all of that content at any time. OpenAI may also hang on to your inputs for a while, so see [their privacy policy](<https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy>) for more details.
